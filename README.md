# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Ryan Sorocina

**Here is some stuff about me..**

- Iâ€™m currently working on my associate's degree at Raritan Valley Community College
- I'm majoring in Information Systems and Technology
- I love building computers and running benchmarks on them to see their performance
- In my free time I like to hand draw random things like landscapes or just whatever comes to mind
- I like traveling whenever I get the chance, I've visited Mexico, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Aruba, Hawaii, as well as Slovakia since I have family there.
- I am really bad at coding lol
